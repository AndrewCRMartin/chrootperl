<h1>An introduction to using Perl in Bioinformatics</h1>

<h2>What is Perl?</h2>

<p>Perl stands for 'Practical Extraction and Reporting Language'. It
is designed as a powerful scripting language making it easy and fast
  to implement programs. In particular it is very good at manipulating
  data in files - extracting and reformatting data. It has built in
  functions that make it easy to read lines from a file, split them
  into columns, and to match patterns or 'regular expressions'</p>

<p>Perl is itself a program known as an 'interpreter'. It reads the
  Perl script that you write, interprets the commands that you have
  given and runs them on any data files that you have provided. The
  Perl interpreter is already installed if you are using a Linux
  machine or a Mac - you access it by opening a command line prompt
  (or 'terminal'). If you are using Windows, then you can download and
  install versions of Perl such
  as <a href='http://www.activestate.com/activeperl'>ActivePerl</a> or
  <a href='http://strawberryperl.com/'>Strawberry Perl</a> which can
  be used in the same way. (Even better, stop using Windows and
  install Linux instead!) </p>

<p>To write a Perl script, one normally uses a 'text editor' to create
  the script. A text editor is a program a biut like a word processor,
  but it doesn't do anything fancy like different fonts, text size,
  colours, etc. It simply allows one to create a plain text
  file. You <emph>could</emph> use Word to do that (and select 'Save
  As Plain text'), but it isn't recommended. Under Windows, you can
  use something like 'notepad', but there are better editors available
  such
  as <a href='https://notepad-plus-plus.org/'>NotePad++</a>,
  <a href='http://www.ssesetup.com/textmorph.html'>TextMorph</a>,
  <a href='http://www.pspad.com/en/'>PSPad</a>,
  <a href='http://jedit.org/'>JEdit</a>,
  <a href='https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit'>gEdit</a> or
  <a href='http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/emacs-22.3-bin-i386.zip'>emacs</a>.
  Many of these are also available for Mac and Linux. Emacs is the
  most powerful editor and can do pretty much anything, but may be a
  little harder to learn to use.</p>

<p>Once you have created your program as a text file, you then run it
  through the Perl interpreter and pass any other files or commands
  to the script on the command line. Perl scripts do not (usually) have
  graphical interfaces, so you need to get used to using the command
  line!</p>

<p>In this practical, we have created a simple way for you to enter a
  Perl script via a web page and run it over the web. This is purely
  for this teaching exercise. Once you have learned the basics this
  way, you should use a version of Perl installed on your own
  machine.</p>

<h2>Reading a file</h2>
<p>We are going to start with a very simple program that reads the
  contents of a file and prints it to the screen. The file you are
  going to look at is a PDB file containing the structure of a protein.</p>

<p>Perl provide a very simple way of accessing a file - you simply
  provide the name of the file on the command line after the name of
  the perl script. Something like:</p>

<pre>
   perl myscript.pl myfile.dat
</pre>

<p>The Perl scripting language itself provides a simple way of looping through the lines
  contained in the file. In your Perl script, you simply do:</p>

<pre>
   while(&lt;&gt;)
   {
      # Do something here
   }
</pre>

<p>The <samp>while()</samp> control statment means 'while something
  (contained in the parentheses) is true do whatever is between the
  curly brackets'.</p>

<p>In this case the condition (the thing that has to be true) is
  written as &lt;&gt;. This is a bit of Perl shorthand magic that says
  'read a line from the file specified on the command line'.</p>

<p>The thing between the curly brackets in this case is introduced
  with a # - this introduces a comment. It doesn't do anything at all,
  but helps explain what your code is doing - it just makes things
  more readable.</p>

<p>So if we introduce just one more command, we will have a Perl
  script that can read a file and print its contents to the
  screen. That command is <samp>print</samp>. In Perl we put a
  semi-colon (<samp>;</samp>) after a command to indicate the end of one
  command and separate if from the next command.</p>
   
<p>So here is our complete piece of code. Click the 'Run' button to
  see the results.</p>

<form action='perl.cgi' method='post'>
<textarea cols='80' rows='20' name='script'>
while(<>)
{
    print;
}
</textarea>
<input type='submit' text='Run' />
</form>

<h2>PDB Files</h2>

<p>The file that you have looked at is a PDB file. Here is a small
  snippet of the file:</p>

<pre>
ATOM      9  N   ASP L   1      17.203 -13.024  34.883  1.00 38.78           N

ATOM     12  O   ASP L   1      14.927 -14.498  33.516  1.00 30.05           O  
ATOM     13  CB  ASP L   1      17.376 -13.328  32.457  1.00 35.50           C

ATOM     16  OD2 ASP L   1      16.754 -14.296  30.362  1.00 35.49           O  
ATOM     17  N   ILE L   2      14.151 -12.385  33.618  1.00 27.04           N  
ATOM     18  CA  ILE L   2      12.755 -12.798  33.565  1.00 24.06           C  
ATOM     19  C   ILE L   2      12.335 -12.897  32.106  1.00 23.36           C  
ATOM     20  O   ILE L   2      12.305 -11.898  31.377  1.00 21.75           O  
ATOM     21  CB  ILE L   2      11.835 -11.799  34.294  1.00 23.42           C  
ATOM     22  CG1 ILE L   2      12.257 -11.685  35.767  1.00 24.39           C  
ATOM     23  CG2 ILE L   2      10.384 -12.263  34.194  1.00 22.99           C  
ATOM     24  CD1 ILE L   2      11.437 -10.700  36.576  1.00 23.75           C  
</pre>

<p>For the purposes of this exercise, you can assume that the file
  contains 12 columns, each of which is separated by a space.</p>

<p>The first column is simply a label that tells us what sort of data
  are in this line or 'record' in the file. I've edited the file down
  so that we only have the 'ATOM' records which represent the
  coordinates of the protein - the full file has various
  header information as well 'HETATM' records that represent
  non-protein atoms such as waters.</p>

<p>The second column is a record number - it is simply a unique number
  for each ATOM record.</p>

<p>The third column is the atom type indicating its position within an
  amino acid</p>

<p>The fourth column is the amino acid type.</p>
<p>The fifth column is the chain label - PDB files can contain
  quaternary structure, or complexes between proteins or simply
  multiple copies of the same protein. Each protein chain is given a
  different chain label.</p>
<p>The sixth column is the amino acid number counting from the
  N-terminus of each chain. These numbers can be zero or even
  negative and in some cases can have a letter following the numbers.</p>
<p>The seventh, eighth and ninth columns represent the x,y,z
  coordinates of the atom</p>
<p>The tenth column is the occupancy. This is normally 1.0, but in
  some cases, an atom can be flipping between two (or more) different
  distinct positions. This is indicated by having multiple records
  for the atom with the occupancy indicating the fraction of time
  that the atom spends at that position.</p>
<p>The eleventh column is the 'temperature factor' or 'B-value'. This
  indiates the amount of thermal motion that the atom has - in other
  words how much it is vibrating about the indicated position.</p>
<p>The twelfth column represents the element type.</p>

<h2>Scalar variables</h2>

<p>Let's modify our program so that instead of printing the contents
  of the file, we count the number of lines in the file. To do this we
  need to have what is known as a 'scalar variable'. A bit like in
  algebra this is a way of storing a number or a string (a set of
  characters) in a 'variable'. We introduce scalar variables with
  a <samp>$</samp>, so we can say something like:</p>

<pre>
   $total = 0;
</pre>

<p>Note that the equals sign is used for assignment. The statement
  means 'set the variable <samp>$total</samp> to the value zero.<p>

<p>Remembering that the equals sign is used for assignment not for
  equality as it is in algebra, we can also say things like:</p>

<pre>
   $total = $total + 1;
</pre>

<p>This will increment the value of <samp>$total</samp> i.e. set it to
  one more than it was previously. In fact this is such a common thing
  to do that there is a special syntax for doing it:</p>

<pre>
   $total++;
</pre>

<p>Clearly we can exploit this to count the lines in a file. </p>

<form action='perl.cgi' method='post'>
<textarea cols='80' rows='20' name='script'>
$total = 0;
while(<>)
{
    $total++;
}
print "There were $total lines\n";
</textarea>
<input type='submit' text='Run' />
</form>







<h2>Columns and arrays</h2>

<p> Perl lets you split a line into columns very easily. We can simply
  say:</p>

<pre>
   @columns = split;
</pre>

<p><samp>@columns</samp> is known as an 'array' - its a group of items
  that can be accessed with an index (i.e. a number that represents a
  slot in the array). Think of it as the name of a road of houses -
  you can access the person who lives in a particular house by
  specifying the road name and the house number. The main difference
  is that, in Perl, arrays indices count from zero rather than
  one.</p>

<p>So, in this example, we could access the first column
  using <samp>$columns[0]</samp>, the second column
  with <samp>$columns[1]</samp>, etc. Notice here that we didn't use
  an <samp>@</samp> in front of the name of the array; instead we used
  a <samp>$</samp>. What does this mean? The <samp>@</samp> sign is
  used to refer to the whole array. The <samp>$</samp> is used to
  refer to a single 'slot' in the array because this single slot is
  not an array, it is a 'scalar' variable.</p>
